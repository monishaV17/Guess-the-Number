
**Number Guessing Game**

**Objective**

The user attempts to predict a randomly generated number inside a given range in the straightforward Java console application known as "The Number Guessing Game." The game gives feedback on each guess while testing the player's ability to estimate and think logically.​

**Steps Performed**

*The program creates a random number between 1 and 100.

*There are only seven chances for the user to estimate the number.
​
*Each time an estimate is made, the computer informs whether it is accurate, too high, or too low.​

*Depending on how many attempts are made, the game determines the score for each round.​

*The application keeps track of the user's overall score, average score, and number of rounds played.

*When the program is done, it shows the final results along with a performance rating.

**Tools Used**

Java (JDK) for programming

Java standard libraries: java.util.Scanner for user input and java.util.Random for random number generation​

Console for interaction

**Outcome**

Users can attempt to predict the computer-generated number in a set number of attempts in an entertaining number guessing game. The game tracks cumulative statistics across several rounds, computes round scores, and offers hints. It provides a fun method to hone logical thinking abilities and practice programming principles.
